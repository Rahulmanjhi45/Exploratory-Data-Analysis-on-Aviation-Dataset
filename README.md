# Aviation Data Analysis

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an aviation dataset. The analysis covers various aspects of aviation accidents, including weather conditions, airport analysis, and aircraft models. The goal is to identify patterns, correlations, and insights from the data.



## Project Structure

1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration: This section includes loading the datasets and performing an initial exploration to understand their structure.  
2. Data Cleaning: Cleaning of the dataset by handling missing values, separating numeric and categorical columns, and summarizing the missing data.  
3. Data Preprocessing: Identification and visualization of outliers in the data using IQR.  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization:
     
      1. Weather Conditions: Analysis of weather conditions during accidents.      
      2. Correlation between Weather and Severity: Examination of the correlation between weather conditions and the severity of accidents.    
      3. Airport Analysis: Identification of airports with the highest frequency of accidents.    
      4. Aircraft Models: Analysis of aircraft models with the highest frequency of accidents.    

# Installation
To run the code in this repository, you will need Python and the following libraries:

    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

# Usage

1. Data Loading: Load the aviation dataset and state code dataset. 
2. Initial Exploration: Display the first few rows of each dataset and generate a summary using .info() and .describe() methods.
3. Data Cleaning: Identify columns with missing values, calculate their percentages, and clean the data accordingly.
4. Outlier Detection: Use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify outliers in columns such as 'Total.Fatal.Injuries' and 'Total.Serious.Injuries'.
5. EDA: Conduct exploratory data analysis on weather conditions, correlation between weather and severity, airport analysis, and aircraft models.
